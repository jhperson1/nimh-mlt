Scientific Goal: Understand how mood affects gambling
Data Set: Mood Manipulation Task
Statistical Goal: Examine how neural networks and logistic regressions compare in modeling the data.
Computational Goal: Create a predictive and interpretable model of gambling probability that works for any trial for any subject.

Feature Selection

- Start: Raw Data from Mood Manipulation Interface Task
- Data Analysis: use norm_features.ipynb
- End: x and y csv files where x contains features to predict gambling probability (0 - 1) and y contains the target gambles themselves (1's or 0's)
